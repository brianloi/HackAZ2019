The original csv files from the Kaggle datasets were modified to contain the same countries.
The data of the countries in these datasets were not modified to any extent. 
Jupyter notebook, python, and plotly were primarily used in the development of these data visualizations.

The data used in this project is from 2017.

The Jupyter notebook contains multiple cells that create interactable plots and figures.

The Countries of the World dataset contains factual information such as population, GDP, birth rate,
death rate, and etc.

Based on the birth rate, death rate, and population for countries in 2017, future populations were calculated.

Some statistics were calculated from this data set. For example, growth rate was utilized in order to project the growth rate
of countries and visualize certain countries that will eventually "die" and be extinct.

The World Happiness dataset contains Happiness scores for each country which was calculated by various variables,
as stated on Kaggle.

Statistics were calculated to determine whether or not specific variables of countries has an influence on happiness scores.
These statistics include: the p-values, R-squared values, and happiness. R-squared values were used to determine the correlation 
and significant relationships between variables
